You will help me to create a application for me (front end part, i have done the backend part). It is a simple journaling app but enhanched with AI for english learning as foreign language. The application consist of 2 parts. The dashboard which holds list of previous journal records. And  journal writer which is a view to create or modify journal records.

analyze my request carefullly make sure it is complete, I can give you more information on the details of the app.

Plan in step by step to create the app, create the code in step by step, I will implement it also in step by step coppying the code. First create the code structure and setup the enviroment. 

Do it in step by step carefully slowly but surely

ADD TRANSLATOR IN CASE THE USER FORGET THE ENGLISH WORD OR DO NOT KNOW.


Do it in step by step carefully slowly but surely

The journal writing is done in 2 step:
1. Scaffolding -> creating outlines on what to write.
2. Writing -> rough writing create the actual detailed writing but no need to be so perfect, just make sure the substansial is coherent, make sense, and include all the details and ideas of user.
3. Editing/Finishing -> perfecting the writing, grammar, word choice, etc.


The chat mode will be used to scaffold or find topics for actual journal writing.

We will mainly edit the journal creation window.
I need to make the editor/writer is like writing but guided by AI.

I will make the writing mechanism more comprehensive for journal writing.

The first time user open the writing view. There are some questions and a text field as a place holder. This will be a scaffolding for the writing, making the user easier. 
These questions are general like "what do you do today?" "what new or what unique today" to personalized based with previous journals (see user habits or activities). After some questions likely 2-3 questions, there is a button to chat with an AI to find and dig topics for journal writing (it will be switched to chat mode).

The user can choose to answer the questions or dirrectly chat to AI to dig some topics, or dirrectly write by their own based on their ideas or topic that they wanted in the writing field.


To implement this, there will be a phase buttons, phase 1-2-3, from scaffolding to finishing. There are specific AI behaviors at each phase to guide user for great journal writing. 


## Phase 1:
User can choose to write the outlines manualy, by answering questions, or by chatting with AI. THe behavior of the AI is to provide inspirations, find good and substantial topics for journal writing. help to dig or explore topics to write. User would need to answer it shortly no need too detail, or just the main points. 
User can choose to finish the first phase by asking the AI or AI can decide if the topics is enough.

## Phase 2:
The behavior of the AI is just standby until the user hit "get feedback" button or "Switch to chat mode to ask for something".  
For second phase user will decide if the writing is enough, (user may need to manualy switch to third phase). 

## Phase 3:
At the Third phase the AI will highlight all parts that are incorrect, like grammar, cohesion, etc. To make the writing finish and perfect. suggest word choice or suggest better sentence structure.
The third phase is finished when all errors are solved.
