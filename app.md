You will help me to create a fastapi application for me. It is a simple journaling app but enhanched with AI for english learning as foreign language. The application consist of 2 parts. The dashboard which holds list of previous journal records. And  journal writer which is a view to create or modify journal records.

There will be also login and signup screen with username, email, and password for the users.

#### The dashboard view consist of:
1. Button to create new journal (each day can only create one journal. If user want to add or modify journal on that day, they can) 
2. List of journal (cards) consist of title which automatically generated and first or early part of the content text. And attached photo (if available), date, locations, weather, and person or people involved
3. Number of journal streak (count of consecutive journal day to day. Reset when journal absent in the day)
4. Current date
5. Username/callname

#### Journal creation view consist of:
1. Current date
2. Journal text edit view which enables user to write a journal  directly.
3. Attach picture button
4. AI chatting view with user (can also be a voice chat)

#### Journal creation feature:
1. highlighting special entities or features (person, place/location, time, weather, or goal)
2. auto highliting feature will add small super icon at the end of the entities or features word in the journal
3. The photo can be attached between the text inline.

#### Mechanism of creating a day journal:
There are 2 journal writing mechanism

1. Writing trough AI chatting:
AI can start a conversation give topics and explore topics to help journal writing, keeping it enggaging for the user but usefull journal.
User dont have to write the journal manually in the journal text editor, since it will be automatically edited and generated by AI during the conversation with the AI.

1. Writing manually at journal text editor view with feedback:
user can write on journal text editor directly, edit as they want. User can ask AI for feedback or to find or to carry on the topic to ensure smooth writing and good user experience. user can also choose not to use feedback writing at all.

User can switch between mode 1 and mode 2 during writing or modification

#### There is backend part and the front end part of the application. 
there is also database to store the journal data at least as follow (analyze deeply to handle all the requirements):
users: username, password
journals: date, journal text, conversation session
conversation sessions: conversation content
etc... try analyze and design the database

#### Storage:



#### English learning features:
AI can identify errors and count it in the database for further analysis:
1. gramatical error (structure, pronouns, in on at, try classify any posible grammatical errors)
2. Cohesion (does the writing make sense or not, the text make sense or not)

Lets formulate the design as detail as posible, rewrite all I just asked more structured and better and more complete

analyze my request carefullly make sure it is complete, I can give you more information on the details of the app.
First create the mockup using html. it should be adaptive (works on mobile and pc).

next, lets create the real app in step by step, but let me know all the libraries that you will use.

We will create the real app in step by step, dont do it all at once, i want the app to be comprehensive, complete, and most importantly works flawlessly.
